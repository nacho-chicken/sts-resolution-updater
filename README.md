# Slay the Spire Resolution Updater
### Stop StS from exploding after switching resolutions

---

This program was originally for personal use, but I'm putting it here so that
anyone can get use out of it if they so wish. It has one function:
Setting the display resolution for StS on launch. This is designed specifically
for use on the Steam Deck, but can be easily modified to work on any other
Linux PC or handheld.

I tried my best to cover every weird edge case, but even I know that's
completely impossible.

## Install Guide
1. Place sts-update-resolution.sh in the game install folder,
or some other convenient location
2. Set your Steam launch options to
`/bin/bash [PATH TO SCRIPT HERE]/sts-update-resolution.sh; %command%`
3. Running the game now updates the resolution!
